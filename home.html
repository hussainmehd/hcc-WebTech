I loved it and nothing to complain about
Yasmin Ahmad
Never did I think virtual learning would benefit me as well as face to face but the administration is excellent, so well organized and reachable. I now can’t see myself ever taking face to face because they are so on point with everything. My tutor is so patient and has such a warm personality she makes every lesson so enjoyable and her teaching style is great, I’ve learnt so much within 2 weeks thanks to her.
